Project title
African Population and GDP Analysis

Project description
An end-to-end data analysis project on African population trends using **Python** for data processing and **Tableau** for visual storytelling. This project explores key demographic patterns, growth rates, and urbanization across the African continent.

Project Objective
To explore and visualize African population trends to understand growth rates, regional differences, and urbanization over time.

Dataset Overview
- **File:** `African_population.csv`
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Contents:**
  - Country
  - Year
  - Population
  - Growth Rate
  - Urban Population %
  - Density
  - Region / Subregion
 
  Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Removed missing/null values
- Converted year to `datetime` type
- Removed duplicates
- Removed spaces in the”Population” column

  Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Population distribution by year
- Regional population comparison (North, West, East, etc.)
- Top 10 most and least populated countries
- Countries with the fastest population growth
- Urbanization trends over time
- Correlation between Population and GDP
