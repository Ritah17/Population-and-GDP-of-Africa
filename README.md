Project title
African Population and GDP Analysis

Project description
An end-to-end data analysis project on African population trends using **Python** for data processing and **Tableau** for visual storytelling. This project explores key demographic patterns, growth rates, and urbanization across the African continent.

Project Objective
To explore and visualize African population trends to understand growth rates, regional differences, and urbanization over time.

Tools & Technologies

| Tool       | Purpose                                 |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| Python     | Data cleaning, processing, EDA           |
| Pandas     | DataFrame manipulation                   |
| Tableau    | Interactive dashboards and visualizations|
| Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) | Plotting and EDA    |

Dataset Overview
- **File:** `African_population.csv`
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Contents:**
  - Country
  - Year
  - Population
  - Growth Rate
  - Urban Population %
  - Density
  - Region / Subregion
 
  Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Removed missing/null values
- Converted year to `datetime` type
- Removed duplicates
- Removed spaces in the”Population” column

  Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Population distribution by year
- Regional population comparison (North, West, East, etc.)
- Top 10 most and least populated countries
- Countries with the fastest population growth
- Urbanization trends over time
- Correlation between Population and GDP

   Tableau Visualizations
###Dashboard Highlights:
- **Population Overview**: KPIs, total and annual growth
- **Country Comparison**: Top 10 most populated
- **Regional Analysis**: Map and bar charts by region
- **Trends Over Time**: Line charts of population growth
- **Interactive Filters**: Country, Region, Year.

  Key Insights
- Nigeria leads Africa in population size and growth
- Sub-Saharan countries have the highest growth rates
- Urbanization is rapidly increasing across most regions
- North Africa shows more stable, slower growth

  Conclusion
This analysis supports policymakers, researchers, and development organizations in understanding demographic pressures and planning for urbanization and infrastructure.
